## ✅ Experiment 2 — UI Components & Layouts
**Objective:** Build UI using core Flutter widgets.

### Widgets Covered:
- **Structural widgets:** `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `Container`, `Padding`
- **Layout widgets:** `Row`, `Column`, `Expanded`, `SizedBox`
- **Interactive widgets:** `ElevatedButton`, `TextButton`, `IconButton`
- **Decorative widgets:** `Card`, `CircleAvatar`

**Outcome:** I created a well-structured interface and understood widget trees.

---

## ✅ Experiment 3 — Navigation & Routing
**Objective:** Move between multiple screens using navigation methods.

### Key Learnings:
- `Navigator.push()` and `Navigator.pop()`
- Passing data between screens
- Creating named routes with `MaterialApp(routes: {})`
- Using `Navigator.pushReplacement()` and `pushNamed()`

**Outcome:** I built a functional multi-page Flutter app with smooth navigation.

---

## ✅ Experiment 4 — Forms, Input Handling & Validation
**Objective:** Work with user inputs using forms.

### Concepts Covered:
- `Form` and `TextFormField`
- Form validation using `validator:`
- Controllers to manage values
- Showing validation errors dynamically
- Submit button handling

**Outcome:** I created a complete user input form with validation and proper error handling.

---

## ✅ Experiment 5 — State Management (setState & Provider)
**Objective:** Learn how to manage UI state efficiently.

### Topics Covered:
- When to use `setState()`
- Limitations of `setState()`
- Installing and configuring `provider` package
- Creating app-wide state using:
  - `ChangeNotifier`
  - `ChangeNotifierProvider`
  - `Consumer`

**Outcome:** I built a notes/state-changing UI using Provider, understanding global state sharing.

---

## ✅ Experiment 6 — Custom Widgets
**Objective:** Build reusable UI components.

### Skills Gained:
- Creating custom Dart classes for widgets
- Passing data through constructors
- Designing reusable text fields, buttons, cards
- Improving code readability and maintainability

**Outcome:** You refactored your UI using custom-made widgets.

## ✅ Experiment 7 — Basic Animations
**Objective:** Understand Flutter’s animation system.

### Widgets Practiced:
- `AnimatedContainer`
- `AnimatedOpacity`
- `AnimatedAlign`
- `AnimatedPadding`

**Outcome:** I added smooth transitions and UI animations triggered by user interaction.

---

## ✅ Experiment 8 — Advanced Animations
**Objective:** Add complex animations using Flutter’s animation framework.

### Topics Covered:
- `AnimationController`
- `AnimationBuilder`
- Tween animations (size, color, movement)
- Curved animations (`Curves.easeInOut`)
- Multiple animations in a single widget

**Outcome:** I created professional-level animations suitable for production apps.
